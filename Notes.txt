notes:

rtp countdown excessive? probably
command /utils generates an exception
docs tell players to use /help <rank> but no category exists for that
docs say players can purchase more imbued picks with god rank, this is no longer true


changelog

rtp no longer has a countdown.
god rank locks 175 -> 300 for chests
